Tubular
=======
A project to design and impliment a nicer London Underground line status viewer for mobile devices.
It uses only CSS transistions and default Javascript, and the Google Font 'Lato'. Very much in Alpha - here's a list of known issues:


• Doesn't update. Yeah, there's no connection the API at the moment. It literally doesn't work.

• Line's don't expand on tap on iOS Safari 8.1. So it double-doesn't work on iOS devices.

• Any device with old resolutions (i.e. width<400px) has to scroll left to view all the information. This is because I am lazy.

• I haven't tested on anything beyond a Lumia 920, a friend's old Andriod, an iPhone 4s, and Chrome, Firefox and Safari on OS X Yosemite. So it may do crazy things on browsers that are not that. I don't know, maybe it solves world hunger. Probably not though.


If you want to contribute, well, that would be a miracle. But if you do, then I don't know, submit a merge request or something?
